# Exploration, enhanced
This mod allows players to build their own hike trails around the world. To do so, they need to build so called trail beacons along their trail, then click on every one of them with a new item: the **Trail Map**. Once the trail is fully registered, players can map their whole trail with regular maps and merge them with the trail map in a cartography table. Some dots will now appear on the map, where the player built the Trail Beacons.

## Disclaimer
This mod is currently fully esthetical, and trails does not have any effect yet. I am planning on releasing multiple addons to give a purpose to trails.

# Planned addons
- [👷‍♂️] Trails: Hikers
- [👷‍♂️] Trails: Findings
- [👷‍♂️] Trails: Commerce
- [👷‍♂️] Trails: Refuges & Taverns
- [👷‍♂️] Trails: Equipment
- [👷‍♂️] Trails: Landmarks
- [👷‍♂️] Trails: Beacon Extension
- [👷‍♂️] Trails: Biomes Extension
- [👷‍♂️] Trails: Mods Compat

All those addons will add their piece to the edifice of the trails ecosystem. Details on what they add will be shown on a dedicated YouTube channel, as well as on their mod page once they release.
